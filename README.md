# Boston-House-Price-Predictor
The Machine Learning Model predicts the housing values in the suburbs of Boston on the basis of 12 continuous attributes (including TAX, CRIM, INDUS,etc) and 1 binary-valued attribute. Detailed description of the attributes are mentioned in the housing.names file which can be found on this repository.Initially, it trains three different Regression algorithms namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random forest Regressor,on the data from the data.csv(provided in the repo) to predict the house values and eventually applies the Random Forest Regressor Model which gives least root mean squared error(rmse).For preprocessing the data, we prepare a pipeline constructed with SimpleImputer and StandardScaler transformers.
